# copernicus-toolkit
A collection of OpenCL-based image processing tools for Houdini's Copernicus. Features pixel manipulation algorithms, and other GPU-accelerated image operations.

### Growth Propagation
This tool is designed to streamline the creation of organic growth patterns while maintaining professional-grade performance and flexibility. Originally based on Nick Tylor's Aelib tool, reimplemented and optimized for COPs.
- OpenCL-powered implementation delivers real-time interactivity across thousands of iterations.
- Intuitive interface for generating effects ranging from basic organic mask spreading to complex DLA-style vein structures.
- Comprehensive control system for precise manipulation of growth direction, fade patterns, and blur effects.
